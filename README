Version 1.0 of this library includes support for taking values from the serial terminal and converting
to their numeric values.  

While similar functionality could be achieved with a call to atoi(), this library takes the step of throwing out
characters like letters.  Additionally flags are available when an error occurs.

Tested against Arduino 0022.
